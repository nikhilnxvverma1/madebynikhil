Upto this point, we were&nbsp;creating&nbsp;our user interfaces&nbsp;without any user interactions in them. In this tutorial, we will cover&nbsp;the most important aspect of any user interface i.e. event handling. Before I go forwards, I want to clarify the term "event" in this context. An event can be anything that occurs as part of an ongoing system.&nbsp;Very specifically, "user event" are the events that happen as part of user's interaction&nbsp;with the interface. These include, but are not limited to mouse events (like mouse pressed,mouse dragged, and mouse released events), keyboard events (like key pressed, key released etc) and even scroll events (like scroll started, scrolling, scroll finished).

<strong>General Button based event handling</strong>

Buttons&nbsp;present the most common scenario for handling events.
